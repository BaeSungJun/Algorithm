> ## Problem: [Choose Number 2688](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2668)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
>  There is the map consisted of 2 row and N column. first line in map has N ordered numbers. second line has
  Integer over than 1 less than N. the mission solver has to do is that find the maximum set if a set from 
  first line and a set from second line equals
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>  Simply, these numbers in map could be marked as graph in map. therefore, it called G. Integer numbers in
  graph defined as N. then, the problem is so clear that solver just finds out cirlced sub graph in main graph 
  as many as it has.

> <br />
> ### 3. Making a plan
>  Find out each circled graph and its number puts into the result set. print out it :D 
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 4. Validate a plan
>  it doesn't require to travere multiple times. it could be O(N) time complexity. a number of N is 
  (1 <= N <= 100) enough to pass.
