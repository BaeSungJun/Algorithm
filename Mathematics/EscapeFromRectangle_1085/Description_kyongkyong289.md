# Six Steps
<br />

> ## Problem:[EscapeFromRectangle](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1085)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> You are at (x, y) and rectangle's two diagonal vertices are (0, 0) and (w, h).
> Find the least distance to reach to the edge of the rectangle.
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> Find the least distance to reach to the edge of the rectangle which two diagonal veritices are (0, 0) and (w, h) from (x, y).
> ### 3. Making a plan
> To go to edge of the rectangle, going to the least distance is going to the direction which is parallel to the edges of rectangle.
> We need to find the distance of going directly +x, -x, +y, -y directions and find the least value.
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> Time complexity is O(1). We have enough time to calculate.
> ### 5. Implement
>
> ### 6. How it can be improved
