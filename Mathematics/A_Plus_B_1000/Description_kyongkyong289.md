# Six Steps
<br />

> ## Problem: [A Plus B](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1000)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> Print A + B with given A and B. 
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> This simple problem is about printing A + B with given A and B.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 3. Making a plan
> The input is divided by space. So, we should use map(int, input().split()).
> And we need to print A + B. So we should use print(a + b).
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> There are two numbers so the time complexity is O(1). It's enough.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 5. Implement
