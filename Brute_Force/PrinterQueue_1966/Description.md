# Six Steps

> ## Problem: [Printer Queue ](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1966)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
>  Here is the new printer that check every importance of a paper in the front of a line.
  if a current paper is lower than any left papers, this current paper should be rearranged 
  at the last in the line. what solver has to do is finding out how many times would take 
  to print out for a given paper.
  <br /> 
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>  First of all, check out how many times would take to print out for a target **(Here i call this M).**
  if a current paper, It should be rearranged at the last
    A number of testcase is given at the first line. what would be given next line is N, M
  N is a number of papers, M is the target to check out (0 <= M < N). lastly, we got a line for importances.
  each importance, I is 1 <= I < 10.
