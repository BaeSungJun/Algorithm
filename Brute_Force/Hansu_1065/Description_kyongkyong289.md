# Six Steps
> ## Problem: [Hansu 1065](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1065)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> Hansu is a number which digits are arithmetic sequence. Find number of hansu which is same or less than number. 
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> Find number of hansu which is same or less than N for given N. (1 <= N <= 1000)
> ### 3. Making a plan
> We are going to use brute force.
> We are going to find digits of number from 1 to N.
> If digits are arithmetic sequence, then we can add number of hansu by 1.
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> Time complexity is O(N), since N is less than 1000, we have enough time to calculate.
> ### 5. Implement
> Here is my first code using brute force.
