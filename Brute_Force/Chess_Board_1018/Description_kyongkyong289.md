# Six Steps
<br />

> ## Problem: [Chess Board](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1018)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> The chessboard which size rows M, columns N is given. Chessboards are cut in 8x8 piece. To make a chessboard, you must
> refill the colors. Find at least times to refill with given chessboard.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> Find at least differences between original chessboard and 8x8 cut board.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 3. Making a plan
> We are going to use brute_force. This means we are going to check every cut of the board and compare with original chess board.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> We need to compare every rows and every columns so the time complexity is O(n^2).
> since maximum values of rows and columns are 50, It's enough.
