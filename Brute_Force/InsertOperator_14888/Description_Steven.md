# Six Steps
<br />

> ## Problem: [Insert Operator 14888](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14888)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
>  There are four operators "+", "-", "\*", "/". nomarlly, expression can be consisted of numbers and these operators.
  if numbers, A(1), A(2), ..., A(N) and some operators are given, we can make a expression. here, two main points 
  #1. don't change the order of numbers, #2 operator priority is from the beginning to last in regular sequence. 
  get the maximum and the minimum result in expressions.

> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>  Make expressions from given numbers and operators. the order of given numbers should not be changed. get the maximum and
  the minimum result.
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 3. Making a plan
>  Make all expressions by using brute force. there are two options, an operator uses or don't use. just put an operator into
  expression or not until it doesn't exceed to the limitation. get the maximum and the minimum result. print out

> ### 4. Validate a plan
>  it gonna take O(n^4) enough to pass the problem :D.
