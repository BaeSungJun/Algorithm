# Algorithm

> ## Purpose & Goal
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc.  
> indeed, I whis this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **largest tech compaines** as well as
> solving more than 1500 algorithm problems provided by Backjun to be in the top 1000.
> 
> Especially, one of my `goals` is getting to the World Finals at Codejam. Some people wanna be adept at discrete mathematics 
> whenever they solve algorithm problems or working on something related to software engineering. so this project gonna give them
> mathematical thinking by solving somoe PS.

## How the project will work

> #### There are five steps that we have to know
>
>
>> 1. Solving 3 Problems of which part are random for a week at least and it gonna be saved each folder related to the part.
>> 2. Each problem has to be written with given a 6 steps file.
>>	
```						  
							* Six Steps *
					1. Reading a problem and understand what it means
					2. Redefine a problem with some familiar terms
					3. Make a plan to solve it
					4. Validate a Plan
					5. Implement it as a program
					6. Find out how it can be improved
```
>>
>> 3. After solving a problem, check out others program to compare with my code or review the code yourself.
>>
>> 4. At least, do code review 3 times for a week on your code or your partner.
>>
>> 5. Here is my [discord server](https://discord.gg/XGZPkh), join here :D

>> @ this is the [example](https://github.com/DevStevenLee/Algorithm/tree/master/BinarySearch/WeightLimit_1939) for this step.
