# Algorithm

> ## Purpose & Goal
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc.  
> indeed, I whis this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **largest tech compaines** as well as
> solving more than 1500 algorithm problems provided by Backjun to be in the top 1000.
> 
> Especially, one of my `goals` is getting to the World Finals at Codejam. Some people wanna be adept at discrete mathematics 
> whenever they solve algorithm problems or working on something related to software engineering. so this project gonna give them
> mathematical thinking by solving somoe PS.

## How the project will work

> #### There are four steps that we have to know
>
>
>> 1. Solving 4 Problems of which part are random for a week except Sunday and it gonna be saved each folder related to part
>> 2. Each problem is given with a file that would be written with 6 steps
>>	
```						  
							* Six Steps *
					1. Reading a problem and understand what it means
					2. Redefine a problem with some familiar terms
					3. Make a plan to solve it
					4. Validate a Plan
					5. Implement it as a program
					6. Find out how it can be improved
```
>>
>> 3. After solving a problem, check out others program to compare with my code.
>>
>> 4. On sunday, do a code review
