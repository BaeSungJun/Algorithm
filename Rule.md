# Rule

### Rule for study
> 1. Solving 3 problems of which part are random for a week at least and i gonna be saved each folder related to the part.
> <br />
>
> 2. At least, do code review 3 times for a week on your code or you partner.
> <br />
>
> 3. Each problem has to be written with given a 6 steps file.

<br />

### How to study
> 1. Fork the [algorithm study](https://github.com/DevStevenLee/Algorithm)
> <br />
>
> 2. Go to the right repo matching the part of problem you gonna solve.
> <br />
>
> => For example, If you work on brute force problem like seven dwarfs problem, it should be placed in Brute force folder
> If there doesn't exist what you look for, make the new repo for your problem like making a Dynamic Programming that have not
> existed. After making, copy the description in the root folder into the new folder you just made.
> <br />
>
> 3. Before you start solving problem, you need to make your own folder naming same the problem. also, copy the description
> in the parent folder into the new repo :D here, you should rename it to Description\_(your name)
> <br />
> 
> => For example, If you try to solve seven dwarfs 1321 problem, create the SevenDwarfs\_1321\_(your name) 
  with the Description\_(your name)
> <br />
>
> 4. Time to write the description basically, you know how to use it but don't write 5, 6 yet
> <br />
>
> 5. Start write coding :). the file name should be (problem name\_your name). After this commit it.
> <br />
>
> 6. Pull request
> <br />
>
> 7. After it's accepted by a manager, write the url of your code in Github into the step 5 of the descrption.


### How to code review
> 1. Look for the problem you wanna do a code review.
> <br />
>
> 2. Choose the specific target.
> <br />
>
> 3. Read a someone's code and try to get the more efficient way than the current code.
> <br />
>
> 4. Make a new branch where you gonna work on problem, programming with you idea !!
> <br />
>
> 5. Write the step 6 of the someone's description why it wan not effective, why your approaching is better the writer.
> <br />
>
> => Here is the [example](https://github.com/DevStevenLee/Algorithm/blob/master/BinarySearch/WeightLimit_1939/Description_Steven.md) for this
> <br />
>
> 6. Write the step 5 with the number of how many times it patched, time and a Writer
> <br />
>
> => Here is the [example](https://github.com/DevStevenLee/Algorithm/blob/master/BinarySearch/WeightLimit_1939/Description_Steven.md)
> <br />
>
> 7. Commit it with how many times it patched
