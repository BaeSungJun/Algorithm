# Six Steps
<br />

> ## Problem: snail on the ground. the snail is will go to up wood stick Vm height. snail can move up at am Am. but, on the pm that is slip Bm. and after arrived top it's dont slip.

> ### 1. Understanding problem
>   we have to finish on 0.15 second so we can't using statements
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>   Receive input A, B, V (1 <= B < A <= V <= 1,000,000,000>
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 3. Making a plan
>   One day snail move up to (A-B)m each so, snail just move by total Vm.
>   But when he don't slip arrive at top think about that's same move on total(V - B)m
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 4. Validate a plan
>   (V - B - 1) / (A - B) + 1;
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 5. Implement
