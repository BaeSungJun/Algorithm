# Six Steps

> ## Problem: [Immigration Examination 3079](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3079)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
>  There is the Croatian delegation consisting of M people. There are N check-in desks open.
  officals operate at different speeds. At the k-th dest, T(k) seconds are required to finish chech in.
  A person can only occupy an available dest. At the moment, the person can immediately occupy the dest
  (if there is one), but !! can also choose to wait for another dest. the mission is finding the moment
  when all of them have finished check in is as soon as possible.

> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>  Let's assume that predicate P is taking the time to finish check in for the number of M people through T(n) (1 <= n <= 100,000)
  the main point is that each offical is independent which means, it doesn't affect any workers !! 
  basically, it's just a rotation. therefore, every sum of T(k) | taking time at T(k) supposed to be the number of people.
