> ## Problem: [Sum of four integers to zero](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/7453)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
>  There are arrays A, B, C and D of the same size consisting with integers.
  count the number of pairs which of the sum of A[a], B[b], C[c] and D[d] that equals to zero. 
> <br />
> <br />
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
>>  For all n (size of array) in N, 1 <= n <= 4000 <br />
>>  For all a, b, c, d in Z, -1\*(2^28) <= a, b, c, d <= (2^28) : 
>>    count the number of pairs which of the sum of A[a], B[b], C[c] and D[d] that equals to zero. <br />

> ### 3. Making a plan
>  The size of given values is actually too big to pass the problem using just brute force. so it has to be
  optimized with binary search.

> ### 4. Validate a plan
